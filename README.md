# NextJS

## Why nextJS?

Traditionally, to build a react application from scratch you have to include:
1. Bundling with something like webpack, and transpiling with something like babel
2. Code splitting
3. static pre-rendering, and client vs server side rendering

NextJS takes care of all of those.
